    <string name="before_roam_text">Essential equipment<br/>
        <br/>
Warm and waterproof clothing, a map, compass and good navigation skills are essential, and in addition to the standard equipment for country walks, you should also carry:<br/>
        <br/>
- A survival bag - a heavy-duty bag that keeps your body insulated from the cold in an emergency.<br/>
        <br/>
- A torch and spare batteries<br/>
        <br/>
- A whistle (six blasts of a whistle or six flashes of a torch is the international distress signal)<br/>
        <br/>
- Additional warm clothing (including hat and gloves)<br/>
        <br/>
- High-energy rations (such as mint cake, chocolate, or dried fruit)<br/>
        <br/>
- Water purification tablets\n
        <br/>
- A first aid kit<br/>
        <br/>
- An ice axe and crampons when there is snow or ice on the hills<br/>
        <br/>
If you are likely to encounter heavy snow or ice, wear a pair of heavy-duty winter walking boots that can be fitted with crampons (metal spike attachments that give a better grip on icy terrain) and carry an ice axe. Itâ€™s worth learning how to use them before setting out on your walk as they can cause, rather than prevent, accidents if not used properly.</string>
